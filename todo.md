- [x] Fix Sample Error
- [x] Add the confusion matrix + metrics to the scatterplot
- [x] Add illustration of TP, TN, FP, FN for when we test the candidate (add dashed textures and wavy textures for FP and FN, respectively)
- [x] Place the version at the beginning that just auto-plays, and has the big "start over" button
- [x] Rewrite the general text
- [X] Add a configuration layer that lets things be turned on and off for different parts of the page
- [x] Place a "when you have played the game a few times, scroll down to see how this game can explain many of the challenges in machine learning.  Or skip directly to the full simulator, where you can see illustrations of how different algorithms address these challenges."
- [X] Create a version of the scatterplot that takes in a static set of data
- [X] Use the static set of data in 3 ways for training/testing mismatch, model class-mismatch (xor), and probabalistic/regularization
- [X] Use the example of static data from earlier to draw out the patches on the PAC-learnability proof

- [] Move details to annotations to make it more readable
- [x] Proofread the text
- [] Fix calculations of test error for when there are no points
- [] Fix scroll offset for the scroller buttons
- [x] Add a gamechanger button at the top
- [] Consider adding a table of contents?
- [] Consider adding an info button?
- [] speed seems to be too fast when we get to the bottom.
