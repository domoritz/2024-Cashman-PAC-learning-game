# Probably Approximately Correct Learning: a machine learning game

This repository is the codebase for a blog post designed to illustrate the challenges that machine learning algorithms encounter when trying to fit a dataset.  It is implemented in [idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/), a toolkit for creating data-driven stories and explorable explanations.  

It will be accessible at a public URL once it has been peer-reviewed.

## Installation

    npm install

Then, run the server locally via the `idyll` command, from the root directory.
